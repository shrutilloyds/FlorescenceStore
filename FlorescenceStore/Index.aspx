They deserved to be retained little longer even after their primary usage.While we convert flower waste into incense sticks and essential oils which fill people’s life and their houses with fragrance and aromatic air, we also ensure that our production and packaging should be eco friendly. To meet our packaging needs we also produce hand made paper from the flower waste.</p>

                <p style="color: #edebe6; font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: yellow">Think twice before you dispose your flowers into bin and decide if you want to see them as compost or any other products through which you can feel their lovely smell little longer. Deposit more and more flowers, earn points and redeem your points in getting our products for free.</p>
